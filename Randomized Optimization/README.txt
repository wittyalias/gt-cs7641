=== Instructions  ===

  The following R packages are needed to run the learning programs:
      "GA", "GenSA", "gmodels", "neuralnet"

  Each .R file can be run from RStudio or from the command line. If
  you need to install the previously mentioned packages, it may be
  easier to load the programs into RStudio as there are commands at
  the beginning of each program to install the packages it needs. You
  just need to uncomment them.

  To run from the command line, simply:

      $ Rscript <program>

  Python scripts require the mimicry python library available from:
   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mimicry

  Scripts can be run from the command line:

      $ python <script name>
