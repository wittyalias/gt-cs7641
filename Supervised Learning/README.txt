=== Instructions  ===

  The following R packages are needed to run the learning programs:
      "C50", "class", "dummies", "gmodels", "kernlab", "neuralnet"

  Each .R file can be run from RStudio or from the command line. If 
  you need to install the previously mentioned packages, it may be 
  easier to load the programs into RStudio as there are commands at 
  the beginning of each program to install the packages it needs. You 
  just need to uncomment them.

  To run from the command line, simply:

      $ Rscript <program>
