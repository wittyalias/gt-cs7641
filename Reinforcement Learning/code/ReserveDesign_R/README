This directory contains code to illustrate the use of MDPtoolbox to solve
a dynamic reserve design problem.

___________________________________________________________________________
* The problem *
To reduce biodiversity loss, reserves are created acquiring land through time. 
The problem is to design a dynamic reserve selection policy that maximizes the expected number of species preserved over time.
For a detailed description, see Costello, C. and Polasky, S. 2004. Dynamic reserve site selection. resour Energy Econ 26:157-174.

___________________________________________________________________________
* MDP modelization *
Available sites are irreversibly developed each year with a given probability.
Only a limited number of sites can be reserved each year.
See the complete description in Sabbadin, R. et al. 2007. Dynamic reserve site selection under contagion risk of deforestation. Ecol. Model. 201:75-81.

___________________________________________________________________________
* Install the MDPtoolbox *
Follow the instructions of the Download page of the toolbox website:
http://www7.inra.fr/mia/T/MDPtoolbox/Install.html

___________________________________________________________________________
* Run the resolution *
Download the ReserveDesign file corresponding to the required scientific environment from the Forge page:
https://mulcyber.toulouse.inra.fr/frs/?group_id=11

Decompress files (with unzip or tar xzvf).

In the ReserveDesign directory, launch R/Matlab/GNU Octave/Scilab.

In Matlab, GNU Octave,add the path to the MDPtoolbox directory (to access the toolbox functions mdp_check and mdp_value_iteration) in the run.m script. 

Execute the run script to find an optimal policy to preserved 20 species and visualize a management simulation when the initial state is “all sites available”.
